# Prework - *BG Color Switching App*

Submitted by: **Evan Wu**

**BG Color Switching App** is an app that allows the user to randomly change the background color of their view.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **user** functionality is completed:

- [yes] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [yes] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Apple Music
- Organization. Users can group songs into different playlists
- Running in the background. Music plays even if you aren't in the app
2. Google Maps
- Location detecting/GPS features
- Algorithmically computes shortest paths and travel times
3. Tiktok
- Powerful recommendation algorithm that seems to know what you want to see
- Hosts millions of videos and delivers them quickly to the user
4. Robinhood
- Allows users to trade financial stocks inside an app
- Easy to use interface for viewing stock information

An app I would like to build is a wordle solver that the user can use while playing the wordle puzzle. Users would submit their guesses and mark the color outcomes for each guess. The app would then narrow down the possible words that could be the answer and provide the user with the optimal future guesses.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Getting used to XCode's many features and panels from device view to storyboard mode and simulator was a novel experience.
